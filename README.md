# ClassTrackerISU
Get texts when a class becomes available at Iowa State


## Setup
- Create .env file with "ACCOUNT_SID" (from Twilio), "AUTH_TOKEN" (from Twilio), and "NUMBER_FROM" (from Twilio), "NUMBER_TO" (your own number, following the format "+{areacode}{number}", for example "+15555555555")
- run "pip install twilio"
- change class information to certain class (I will make it easier in the future)
- run "npm run dev"
- boom! running locally
